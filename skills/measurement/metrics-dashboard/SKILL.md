# Metrics Dashboard Design

## Description

Defines a product metrics architecture: North Star metric, input metrics, guardrail metrics, and counter-metrics. Produces a dashboard specification that connects daily tactical metrics to strategic outcomes. Based on the Amplitude/Sean Ellis North Star framework and Reforge metrics methodology.

## When to Use

- Setting up metrics for a new product or feature
- Redesigning a metrics framework that's become noisy or misaligned
- Aligning teams on what "success" means quantitatively
- Preparing for a data-informed planning cycle

## Depth

| Scope | Use When | Sections to Include |
|---|---|---|
| **Light** | Quick alignment on what to measure for a new feature | North Star Metric, Input Metrics |
| **Standard** | Setting up metrics for a product area or redesigning a stale framework | All sections |
| **Deep** | Org-wide metrics overhaul or board-level reporting setup | All sections + metric dependency map, instrumentation plan with engineering owners, data quality audit |

**Omit rules:** At Light depth, skip Guardrail Metrics, Counter-Metrics, and Dashboard Specification. Produce only the North Star definition and input metric decomposition.

## Framework

### Step 1: Define the North Star Metric

The single metric that best captures the value your product delivers to customers.

**Criteria for a good North Star:**
- Reflects customer value delivered (not just business revenue)
- Is a leading indicator of sustainable business success
- Is actionable by the product team
- Is measurable with current instrumentation

```markdown
## North Star Metric

**Metric:** [Name — e.g., "Weekly active projects with 3+ collaborators"]
**Definition:** [Precise technical definition — what counts, what doesn't]
**Current value:** [baseline]
**Target:** [goal by date]
**Why this metric:** [How it captures customer value delivery]

**Validation checklist:**
- [ ] If this metric goes up, the business gets healthier
- [ ] If the business gets healthier, this metric goes up
- [ ] The product team can directly influence this metric
- [ ] We can measure it reliably today
```

### Step 2: Map Input Metrics

Input metrics are the levers that drive the North Star. They decompose the North Star into actionable components.

```markdown
## Input Metrics (levers that drive the North Star)

### North Star = [formula showing how inputs compose]
Example: Weekly Active Projects = New Projects Created × Activation Rate × Retention Rate

| Input Metric | Definition | Current | Target | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| New projects created/week | Projects created by new + existing users | [N] | [target] | Growth |
| Activation rate | % of new projects that reach [milestone] in 7 days | [%] | [target] | Onboarding |
| Weekly retention | % of active projects still active the following week | [%] | [target] | Core product |
| Collaborators per project | Avg users per active project | [N] | [target] | Collaboration |
```

### Step 3: Define Guardrail Metrics

Guardrails ensure you're not gaming the North Star at the expense of something important.

```markdown
## Guardrail Metrics (must NOT degrade)

| Guardrail | Definition | Threshold | Why It Matters |
|---|---|---|---|
| Page load time (p95) | 95th percentile load time | < 3 seconds | Growth can't come at the cost of performance |
| Error rate | % of API requests returning errors | < 0.5% | Reliability is table stakes |
| Support ticket volume | Tickets per 1,000 active users | < [N] | Feature quality shouldn't burden support |
| NPS | Net Promoter Score (quarterly) | > [N] | Quantitative growth without qualitative satisfaction is unsustainable |
```

### Step 4: Add Counter-Metrics

Counter-metrics detect when an optimization in one area causes harm in another.

```markdown
## Counter-Metrics (watch for negative side effects)

| Optimization | Counter-Metric | Watch For |
|---|---|---|
| Increasing activation | Time-to-churn | Are we activating low-quality users who churn fast? |
| Growing seat count | Usage per seat | Are new seats actually using the product? |
| Reducing onboarding steps | Support tickets from new users | Did we cut too much and confuse people? |
```

### Step 5: Dashboard Specification

```markdown
## Dashboard Layout

### Executive View (weekly review)
- North Star metric: [trend line, WoW change]
- Input metrics: [sparklines with targets]
- Guardrails: [status indicators — green/yellow/red]

### Team View (daily)
- Input metrics with daily granularity
- Segmented by: [cohort, platform, plan type]
- Anomaly alerts: [when metric moves >2 standard deviations]

### Experiment View (per experiment)
- Treatment vs. control for target metric
- Statistical significance indicator
- Impact on guardrail metrics

## Data Sources
| Metric | Source System | Update Frequency | Known Limitations |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Metric] | [Analytics tool] | [Real-time / Daily / Weekly] | [Data delay, sampling, etc.] |

## Alert Rules
| Condition | Severity | Notify | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| North Star drops >10% WoW | Critical | [Slack channel + PagerDuty] | Investigate within 2 hours |
| Guardrail crosses threshold | Warning | [Slack channel] | Review within 24 hours |
| Input metric misses target 3 weeks running | Info | [Weekly review agenda] | Discuss in planning |
```

## Minimum Evidence Bar

**Required inputs:** Product or feature description, target user segment, at least one known business objective, current instrumentation capabilities.

**Acceptable evidence:** Existing analytics data, user research findings, business KPIs, product usage logs, stakeholder interviews about what "success" means.

**Insufficient evidence:** If the team cannot define what user value the product delivers or cannot instrument the proposed North Star today, stop and recommend running a user-research-synthesis or jobs-to-be-done discovery sprint before attempting this skill. A metrics architecture built on an unvalidated value hypothesis will mislead rather than inform.

**Hypotheses vs. findings:**
- **Findings:** Current metric baselines, existing instrumentation gaps, known data source limitations — must be grounded in evidence.
- **Hypotheses:** Proposed North Star rationale, input metric decomposition, predicted counter-metric risks — must be labeled as assumptions to validate.

## Output Format

Produce a Metrics Architecture Document with:
1. **North Star Metric** — definition, rationale, target
2. **Input Metrics** — decomposition of the North Star into actionable levers
3. **Guardrail Metrics** — what must not degrade
4. **Counter-Metrics** — side effect detection
5. **Dashboard Specification** — layout, data sources, alert rules

**Shipwright Signature (required closing):**
6. **Decision Frame** — recommended North Star with rationale, trade-off vs. alternative candidates, confidence with evidence quality (data availability, instrumentation readiness), owner, decision date, revisit trigger
7. **Unknowns & Evidence Gaps** — metrics that cannot be instrumented yet, unvalidated causal assumptions in the input metric decomposition
8. **Pass/Fail Readiness** — PASS if North Star meets all four validation criteria and at least 3 input metrics are instrumentable today; at Light depth, PASS if North Star meets all four validation criteria and input metric decomposition is logically sound — instrumentability verification is deferred; FAIL if North Star is a vanity metric or no baseline data exists
9. **Recommended Next Artifact** — Which Shipwright skill to run next and why

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Revenue as North Star** — Revenue is a lagging business metric, not a product health indicator
- **Too many metrics** — 1 North Star, 3-5 inputs, 3-4 guardrails. More than that and nothing gets attention.
- **No guardrails** — Without guardrails, teams optimize the North Star by degrading everything else
- **Vanity metrics** — Page views, total registered users, and "downloads" feel good but don't drive decisions
- **Unmeasurable metrics** — If you can't instrument it today, it can't be a North Star today

## Weak vs. Strong Output

**Weak:**
> "North Star Metric: Monthly Active Users."

No definition of "active," no validation against the four criteria, no connection to customer value — MAU is a vanity metric in disguise.

**Strong:**
> "North Star Metric: Weekly teams completing at least one shared workflow. Definition: distinct team accounts where 2+ members execute a collaborative workflow within a 7-day window. Current: 1,240. Target: 2,000 by Q3. Why: captures both activation and collaboration value, validated against all four criteria."

Precise definition, measurable baseline, target with timeline, and explicit rationale tying the metric to customer value.
