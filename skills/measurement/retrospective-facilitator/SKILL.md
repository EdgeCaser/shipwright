# Retrospective Facilitator

## Description

Runs structured team retrospectives using proven formats (Start/Stop/Continue, 4Ls, Sailboat, Mad/Sad/Glad). Produces an action item list with owners, due dates, and follow-up mechanisms to ensure retro outcomes actually lead to change.

## When to Use

- End of sprint retrospectives
- Post-launch reviews
- Post-incident retrospectives
- Quarterly team health checks
- After any significant milestone or project completion

## Available Formats

### Format 1: Start / Stop / Continue

Best for: Regular sprint retros. Simple and actionable.

```markdown
## Start (things we should begin doing)
- [Suggestion] — Raised by: [name/role]
  - Why: [reasoning]

## Stop (things we should stop doing)
- [Suggestion] — Raised by: [name/role]
  - Why: [reasoning]

## Continue (things that are working well)
- [Observation] — Raised by: [name/role]
  - Evidence: [why this is working]
```

### Format 2: 4Ls (Liked, Learned, Lacked, Longed For)

Best for: Post-project or post-launch retros. Good for capturing learnings.

```markdown
## Liked (what went well)
- [Item]

## Learned (new insights or skills gained)
- [Item]

## Lacked (what was missing)
- [Item]

## Longed For (what we wish we had)
- [Item]
```

### Format 3: Sailboat

Best for: Visual teams. Good for identifying risks alongside positives.

```markdown
## Wind (what propelled us forward)
- [Tailwind factor]

## Anchor (what held us back)
- [Drag factor]

## Rocks (risks ahead)
- [Upcoming risk]

## Island (our goal / destination)
- [What we're sailing toward]
```

### Format 4: Mad / Sad / Glad

Best for: Emotional check-ins. Good when team morale needs attention.

```markdown
## Mad (frustrated about)
- [Item]

## Sad (disappointed about)
- [Item]

## Glad (happy about)
- [Item]
```

## Depth

| Scope | Use When | Sections to Include |
|---|---|---|
| **Light** | Quick end-of-sprint check-in with a stable team | Set the Stage, Gather Input (one format), Action Items |
| **Standard** | Regular sprint or post-launch retro | All sections |
| **Deep** | Post-incident review, post-mortem, or quarterly team health check | All sections + timeline reconstruction, contributing factor analysis, systemic pattern review across past 3+ retros |

**Omit rules:** At Light depth, skip Discuss Top Themes and Review Previous Action Items. Produce only observations and an owned action item list.

## Framework

### Step 1: Set the Stage

```markdown
## Retrospective: [Sprint/Project/Event Name]
**Date:** [date]
**Participants:** [names]
**Facilitator:** [name]
**Format:** [chosen format]
**Time scope:** [what period are we reflecting on]

### Ground Rules
- Focus on processes and systems, not individuals
- Assume positive intent
- Be specific — "communication was bad" → "We didn't have a single source of truth for the API spec, which caused 3 misalignment bugs"
- Everyone participates
```

### Step 2: Gather Input

For each format category, gather observations:

```markdown
## Observations

[Use the chosen format structure above]

### Themes (clustered from raw observations)
| Theme | Observations | Votes/Frequency |
|---|---|---|
| [Theme 1 — e.g., "Requirements clarity"] | [N] related items | [N] votes |
| [Theme 2 — e.g., "Cross-team communication"] | [N] related items | [N] votes |
| [Theme 3] | [N] | [N] |
```

### Step 3: Discuss Top Themes

For each prioritized theme (top 2-3 by votes):

```markdown
### Theme: [Name]

**What happened:**
[Factual description of the issue or success]

**Root cause(s):**
- [Cause 1]
- [Cause 2]

**Impact:**
[How this affected the team, product, or users]

**Proposed action:**
[Specific, actionable improvement]
```

### Step 4: Define Action Items

```markdown
## Action Items

| # | Action | Owner | Due Date | Status | Success Criteria |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | [Specific action] | [Name] | [Date] | Open | [How we know it's done] |
| 2 | [Specific action] | [Name] | [Date] | Open | [How we know it's done] |
| 3 | [Specific action] | [Name] | [Date] | Open | [How we know it's done] |

### Follow-Up Plan
- Action items reviewed at: [next retro / standup / 1:1]
- Accountability mechanism: [how we'll track progress]
```

### Step 5: Review Previous Action Items

```markdown
## Previous Retro Action Items (Review)

| Action | Owner | Status | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Action from last retro] | [Name] | [Done / In Progress / Not Started] | [What happened] |
```

## Minimum Evidence Bar

**Required inputs:** Time scope of the retrospective, list of participants, at least one concrete observation or data point per format category.

**Acceptable evidence:** Participant observations, sprint velocity data, incident timelines, user feedback excerpts, previous retro action item status.

**Insufficient evidence:** If fewer than 3 participants contributed observations or no specific examples are provided (only vague sentiments), stop and recommend an async input collection round (survey or Slack thread) to gather concrete observations before running this skill. Themes derived from vague sentiments produce action items nobody acts on.

**Hypotheses vs. findings:**
- **Findings:** Observed events, measured outcomes, action item completion status — must reference what actually happened.
- **Hypotheses:** Root cause explanations and proposed process changes — must be labeled as team-generated theories to test.

## Output Format

Produce a Retrospective Report with:
1. **Setup** — date, participants, format, scope
2. **Observations** — gathered input using the chosen format
3. **Themes** — clustered and prioritized
4. **Discussion** — root causes and proposed actions for top themes
5. **Action Items** — owned, dated, with success criteria
6. **Previous Items Review** — accountability check

**Shipwright Signature (required closing):**
7. **Decision Frame** — top process change recommendation, trade-off (effort to implement vs. expected improvement), confidence with evidence quality (number of corroborating observations, recurrence across retros), owner, decision date, revisit trigger
8. **Unknowns & Evidence Gaps** — themes raised by only one person, root causes not yet validated, missing perspectives from absent team members
9. **Pass/Fail Readiness** — PASS if at least 2 owned action items with due dates and success criteria exist; FAIL if action items are unowned. (At Light depth, theme consensus is not evaluated since theme discussion is omitted.)
10. **Recommended Next Artifact** — Which Shipwright skill to run next and why

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **No action items** — A retro without actions is just venting
- **Unowned actions** — "The team will improve communication" means nobody will
- **Never reviewing past actions** — Without follow-through, teams stop trusting retros
- **Blame culture** — Focus on systems and processes, not individuals
- **Always the same format** — Rotate formats to keep retros fresh and surface different insights

## Weak vs. Strong Output

**Weak:**
> "Action item: Improve communication. Owner: The team. Due: Ongoing."

No specific behavior change, no individual owner, no deadline, no success criteria — this will never get done.

**Strong:**
> "Action item: Create a shared #api-changes Slack channel and post breaking changes 48 hours before merge. Owner: Sarah (tech lead). Due: 2026-04-01. Success criteria: zero surprise API breakages in the next sprint."

Specific mechanism, named owner, concrete deadline, and a measurable way to know if it worked.
