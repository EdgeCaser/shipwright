# Decision Log / Product Decision Record (PDR)

## Description

Captures product decisions in a structured, searchable format inspired by Architecture Decision Records (ADRs). Documents the context, options considered, decision made, and consequences — creating institutional memory that prevents relitigating settled decisions and helps new team members understand why things are the way they are.

## When to Use

- Any time a significant product decision is made (scope, strategy, prioritization, trade-off)
- When a decision is likely to be questioned later ("why did we do it this way?")
- During retrospectives when the team realizes decisions aren't being documented
- Onboarding new PMs or team members who need to understand historical context
- When the same decision keeps getting relitigated in meetings

## Framework

### Product Decision Record Template

```markdown
# PDR-[NNN]: [Decision Title]

## Status
[Proposed / Accepted / Deprecated / Superseded by PDR-XXX]

## Date
[Date decision was made]

## Decision-Maker
[Who made the final call — name and role]

## Participants
[Who was involved in the discussion]

## Context
[What situation or problem prompted this decision? Include relevant background, constraints, and timing pressures. Write this for someone who wasn't in the room.]

## Decision
[State the decision clearly and unambiguously in 1-3 sentences.]

## Options Considered

### Option A: [Name]
- **Description:** [What this option entails]
- **Pros:** [Advantages]
- **Cons:** [Disadvantages]
- **Estimated effort:** [If relevant]

### Option B: [Name] (CHOSEN)
- **Description:** [What this option entails]
- **Pros:** [Advantages]
- **Cons:** [Disadvantages — yes, document the downsides of the chosen path too]
- **Estimated effort:** [If relevant]

### Option C: [Name]
- **Description:** [What this option entails]
- **Pros:** [Advantages]
- **Cons:** [Disadvantages]

## Rationale
[Why Option B was chosen over the others. Be specific about the trade-offs that were made and the values or priorities that drove the decision.]

## Consequences

### What this enables:
- [Positive consequence 1]
- [Positive consequence 2]

### What this constrains:
- [Constraint 1 — future options we're giving up]
- [Constraint 2]

### What we're accepting:
- [Known downside we're choosing to live with]
- [Technical debt or limitation we're taking on]

## Revisit Criteria
[Under what conditions should we reconsider this decision?]
- [Trigger 1 — e.g., "If [metric] drops below [threshold]"]
- [Trigger 2 — e.g., "If [assumption] turns out to be false"]
- [Trigger 3 — e.g., "At the [Q3] strategy review"]

## Related Decisions
- [PDR-XXX]: [Related decision title]
- [PDR-YYY]: [Decision this supersedes or builds on]
```

### Decision Categories

Tag each PDR with a category for searchability:

| Category | Examples |
|---|---|
| **Scope** | "Descoped feature X from v1," "Added requirement Y" |
| **Strategy** | "Focus on SMB before enterprise," "Build vs. buy for Z" |
| **Prioritization** | "Chose initiative A over B for Q2" |
| **Technical** | "Selected Postgres over DynamoDB," "Adopted microservices" |
| **Design** | "Chose wizard over inline setup," "Adopted design system X" |
| **Pricing** | "Moved from per-seat to usage-based," "Added free tier" |
| **Process** | "Adopted 2-week sprints," "Changed release cadence" |
| **Partnership** | "Integrated with X instead of Y," "Selected vendor Z" |

### Decision Severity

| Severity | Criteria | Reversibility | Approval Required |
|---|---|---|---|
| **S1 — Strategic** | Changes product direction, affects multiple teams | Hard to reverse | VP/C-level |
| **S2 — Significant** | Affects scope, timeline, or resources for a major initiative | Moderate to reverse | PM + Engineering Lead |
| **S3 — Tactical** | Affects current sprint or feature implementation details | Easy to reverse | PM or Tech Lead |

### Decision Log Index

Maintain a running index:

```markdown
## Decision Log — [Product Name]

| PDR | Date | Title | Category | Severity | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PDR-001 | 2026-01-15 | Focus on SMB before enterprise | Strategy | S1 | Accepted |
| PDR-002 | 2026-01-22 | Use event-driven architecture for notifications | Technical | S2 | Accepted |
| PDR-003 | 2026-02-03 | Descope advanced analytics from v1 launch | Scope | S2 | Accepted |
| PDR-004 | 2026-02-10 | Adopt usage-based pricing for API product | Pricing | S1 | Accepted |
```

## Output Format

Produce:
1. **Decision Record** — fully structured PDR for the specific decision
2. **Decision Log Entry** — row for the index
3. **Communication Summary** — who needs to be informed and how (for S1 and S2 decisions)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Only documenting the decision, not the alternatives** — Future teams need to know what was considered and rejected
- **Missing the "why"** — The rationale is the most important part; "we chose B" without "because X" is useless
- **No revisit criteria** — Without these, decisions are permanent by default even when conditions change
- **Documenting too late** — Write the PDR when the decision is made, not weeks later when memory has faded
- **Only documenting big decisions** — S3 decisions add up; a light-touch PDR is better than no record at all
