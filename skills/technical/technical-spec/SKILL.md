# Technical Spec Writing

## Description

Translates product requirements (PRDs, user stories) into engineering-ready technical specifications. Covers system architecture decisions, API contracts, data models, non-functional requirements, and migration plans. Bridges the gap between "what to build" (PM) and "how to build it" (engineering).

## When to Use

- After a PRD is approved and before engineering estimation begins
- When a feature requires significant architectural decisions
- When multiple engineering teams need to coordinate on an implementation
- As a PM who wants to speak engineering's language and earn technical credibility

## Depth

| Scope | Use When | Sections to Include |
|---|---|---|
| **Light** | Small feature or isolated backend change | Context & Motivation + System Architecture + API Contract |
| **Standard** | Typical feature spanning multiple components | All sections |
| **Deep** | Platform migration, new system, or multi-team coordination | All sections + load test plan, detailed ADRs per component, cross-service sequence diagrams, rollback rehearsal script |

**Omit rules:** At Light depth, skip Non-Functional Requirements and Rollout & Migration. Produce only Context, Architecture (components table + one ADR), and API Contract.

## Framework

### Step 1: Context & Motivation (Engineering Perspective)

```markdown
# Technical Specification: [Feature Name]

## Metadata
- PRD Reference: [link to PRD]
- Author: [PM + Tech Lead]
- Reviewers: [engineering, security, infra]
- Status: [Draft / In Review / Approved]
- Last updated: [date]

## Context
**What we're building:** [1-2 sentences — from the PRD]
**Why (business):** [Key metric we're moving and by how much]
**Why (technical):** [Technical motivation — e.g., "Current system can't support X"]

## Scope
**In scope:** [Specific capabilities this spec covers]
**Out of scope:** [What's explicitly NOT covered — defer to future specs]
**Assumptions:** [Technical assumptions we're making]
```

### Step 2: System Architecture

```markdown
## Architecture

### High-Level Design
[Describe the architecture at a block-diagram level]

```
[Client] → [API Gateway] → [Service A] → [Database]
                         → [Service B] → [Message Queue] → [Worker]
```

### Components Affected
| Component | Change Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [Service A] | Modify | [What changes and why] |
| [Service B] | New | [New service needed for X] |
| [Database] | Schema change | [New tables/columns] |
| [Client] | UI update | [New screens/flows] |

### Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
For each significant choice:

#### ADR 1: [Decision Title — e.g., "Use event-driven architecture for notifications"]
- **Context:** [Why this decision was needed]
- **Options considered:**
  - Option A: [Description] — Pros: [x] / Cons: [y]
  - Option B: [Description] — Pros: [x] / Cons: [y]
- **Decision:** [What we chose]
- **Rationale:** [Why — trade-off analysis]
- **Consequences:** [What this commits us to]
```

### Step 3: API Contract

```markdown
## API Design

### New Endpoints

#### POST /api/v2/[resource]
**Purpose:** [What this endpoint does]
**Authentication:** [Required — Bearer token / API key / etc.]
**Rate limit:** [N requests per minute]

**Request:**
```json
{
  "field_1": "string (required) — description",
  "field_2": 123,              // integer (optional) — description
  "field_3": {                 // object (required)
    "nested_field": "string"
  }
}
```

**Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "field_1": "string",
  "created_at": "2026-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "status": "active"
}
```

**Error Responses:**
| Code | Condition | Response Body |
|---|---|---|
| 400 | Invalid input | `{ "error": "validation_error", "details": [...] }` |
| 401 | Not authenticated | `{ "error": "unauthorized" }` |
| 403 | Not authorized | `{ "error": "forbidden" }` |
| 404 | Resource not found | `{ "error": "not_found" }` |
| 429 | Rate limited | `{ "error": "rate_limited", "retry_after": 60 }` |

### Modified Endpoints
| Endpoint | Change | Backward Compatible? |
|---|---|---|
| [existing endpoint] | [what changes] | [Yes / No — if no, migration plan required] |
```

### Step 4: Data Model

```markdown
## Data Model

### New Tables / Collections

#### [table_name]
| Column | Type | Nullable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| id | UUID | No | gen_random_uuid() | Primary key |
| [field] | VARCHAR(255) | No | — | [description] |
| [field] | INTEGER | Yes | 0 | [description] |
| created_at | TIMESTAMP | No | NOW() | Record creation time |
| updated_at | TIMESTAMP | No | NOW() | Last modification time |

**Indexes:**
- `idx_[table]_[column]` on [column] — for [query pattern]
- `idx_[table]_[col1]_[col2]` on ([col1], [col2]) — for [query pattern]

**Relationships:**
- [table_name].[field] → [other_table].id (foreign key)

### Schema Migrations
| Migration | Description | Reversible? | Estimated Duration |
|---|---|---|---|
| [001_add_table_x] | Creates [table] | Yes | [seconds/minutes] |
| [002_add_column_y] | Adds [column] to [table] | Yes | [time, data volume] |

### Data Volume Estimates
| Table | Expected Rows (Year 1) | Growth Rate | Storage Estimate |
|---|---|---|---|
| [table] | [N] | [X]/month | [GB] |
```

### Step 5: Non-Functional Requirements

```markdown
## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
| Metric | Requirement | Measurement Method |
|---|---|---|
| API response time (p95) | < [N]ms | [APM tool] |
| Page load time (p95) | < [N]s | [RUM / Lighthouse] |
| Throughput | [N] requests/second | [Load testing] |
| Database query time (p95) | < [N]ms | [Query monitoring] |

### Scalability
- Must support [N] concurrent users
- Must handle [N] [operations] per [time period]
- Horizontal scaling strategy: [approach]

### Security
- [ ] Authentication: [method]
- [ ] Authorization: [RBAC / ABAC — describe permission model]
- [ ] Data encryption: At rest [method] / In transit [TLS version]
- [ ] PII handling: [what PII is involved, how it's protected]
- [ ] Audit logging: [what actions are logged]

### Reliability
- Availability target: [99.9% / 99.95% / etc.]
- Failover strategy: [approach]
- Data backup: [frequency, retention]
- Disaster recovery: [RTO and RPO targets]

### Observability
- Logging: [What's logged, at what level]
- Metrics: [Key metrics to instrument]
- Alerting: [Conditions that trigger alerts]
- Dashboards: [What dashboards need updating]
```

### Step 6: Rollout & Migration

```markdown
## Rollout Plan

### Feature Flags
| Flag | Description | Default | Rollout Plan |
|---|---|---|---|
| [flag_name] | [what it controls] | Off | Internal → 10% → 50% → 100% |

### Migration Steps
1. [ ] Deploy database migrations (backward-compatible)
2. [ ] Deploy service changes behind feature flag (off)
3. [ ] Enable for internal users / dogfood
4. [ ] Enable for [X]% of users, monitor for [N] days
5. [ ] Ramp to 100%
6. [ ] Remove feature flag and old code paths

### Rollback Plan
- **Trigger:** [What metric or alert triggers rollback]
- **Steps:** [How to roll back safely]
- **Data implications:** [What happens to data created during the rollout]

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for [components]
- [ ] Integration tests for [API contracts]
- [ ] Load test to [N] concurrent users
- [ ] Security review for [auth, PII handling]
- [ ] Accessibility audit
```

## Minimum Evidence Bar

**Required inputs:** An approved PRD or equivalent product brief with defined scope, target users, and success metrics. Access to the current system architecture (or confirmation this is greenfield).

**Acceptable evidence:** PRD, system architecture diagrams, existing API documentation, performance benchmarks, engineering team input on feasibility, and schema or data model context.

**Insufficient evidence:** If no PRD or product brief exists, state "Insufficient evidence for Context & Motivation" and recommend completing the PRD skill first. If no engineering input is available, state "Architecture decisions are PM hypotheses only" and flag for tech lead review.

**Hypotheses vs. findings:**
- **Findings:** Components affected, API contract schemas, data model structure (must reflect current system state or confirmed engineering decisions)
- **Hypotheses:** Performance targets, data volume estimates, rollout ramp percentages (must be labeled as projections pending load testing or production validation)

## Output Format

Produce a Technical Specification with:
1. **Context & Scope** — what, why, boundaries
2. **Architecture** — system design with ADRs for key decisions
3. **API Contract** — endpoints, request/response schemas, errors
4. **Data Model** — tables, relationships, migrations
5. **Non-Functional Requirements** — performance, security, reliability
6. **Rollout Plan** — feature flags, migration, rollback

**Shipwright Signature (required closing):**
7. **Decision Frame** — recommended architecture approach, trade-off, confidence with evidence quality, owner, decision date, revisit trigger
8. **Unknowns & Evidence Gaps** — unvalidated performance targets, missing data volume estimates, untested migration paths
9. **Pass/Fail Readiness** — PASS if architecture reviewed by tech lead and API contract validated against PRD requirements; FAIL if ADRs list no alternatives considered or rollback plan is absent
10. **Recommended Next Artifact** — Which Shipwright skill to run next and why

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Writing implementation details in the PRD** — The PRD says "what"; the tech spec says "how"
- **No ADRs** — If you chose approach A over B, document why; future engineers will thank you
- **Forgetting non-functionals** — Performance, security, and observability are requirements, not nice-to-haves
- **No rollback plan** — Every deployment should be reversible
- **PM writes tech spec alone** — Co-author with the tech lead; the PM ensures requirements fidelity, the engineer ensures technical feasibility

## Weak vs. Strong Output

**Weak:**
> "ADR: We will use a message queue for async processing."

No alternatives considered, no trade-off analysis, no consequences stated — this is a statement, not a decision record.

**Strong:**
> "ADR: Use RabbitMQ over SQS for notification processing. SQS is simpler but lacks routing key support needed for per-tenant delivery rules. RabbitMQ adds operational overhead (cluster management) but supports the fan-out pattern required by 3 of 4 notification types. Consequence: team must maintain RabbitMQ infrastructure or migrate to managed CloudAMQP ($200/mo at projected volume)."

Names alternatives, explains the deciding factor, and quantifies the operational consequence.
